# Douay Rheims
A plaintext typeset of the 1582 and 1633 printings of the Douay Rheims Bible. The project hierarchy is divided by book, and then each chapter as a .txt file, without verse numberings. Commentary is included in the respective chapter folder.

## Methodology
The Holy Writ is kept the exact same as it was written while retyping it to a digital fontface, with the only exceptions labeled below:
- Where it would make sense, 'u' is converted to 'v' and vice versa.
- "Long S" is rendered as a regular 's', capitalized or lowercase depending on its surroundings.
