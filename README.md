# Douay Rheims
A plaintext typeset of the 1582 and 1633 printings of the Douay Rheims Bible. The project hierarchy is divided by book, and then each chapter as a .txt file. Commentary is included in the respective book folder, labeled as {chapter}.Annotations.txt.

## Methodology
The Holy Writ is kept the exact same as it was written while retyping it to a digital fontface, with the only exceptions labeled below:
- Where it would make sense, 'u' is converted to 'v' and vice versa.
- "Long S" is rendered as a regular 's', capitalized or lowercase depending on its surroundings.
- Where it would make sense, 'i' is converted to a 'j'. This letter doesn't seem to be used in the Douay Rheims, because of the translation's age. 'J' is a textual variant of 'i' in the text, and is thus rendered in modern fonts as a seperate letter.
- Due to limitations in the plain text format, italics are not preserved in the digitized version.
- Due to limitations in the plain text format, Unicode ligatures like 'et' are rendered as their ASCII equivalents.

## Motivation
I hadn't seen any complete attempts to digitize the whole, original Douay Rheims Bible in an open format. I decided to use a series of facsimiles in my possesion to do this work myself. This project should be considered free use for anybody, including those who may want to print and sell Bibles. I have no wish to try to legally encumber the Word of God.
