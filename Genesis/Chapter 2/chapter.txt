1. THE heavens therfore & the earth were fully finished, and al the furniture of them.
2. And the seventh day God ended his worke which he had made; and rested the seventh day, from al worke that he had done. 
3. And he blessed the seventh day & sanctified it: because in it he had ceased from al his worke which God created to make.
