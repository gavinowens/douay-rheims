I. In the beginning. ) Holie Moyses telleth what was done in the beginning of the world, and so forward even til his owne time, writing above two thousand and foure hundreth yeares after the beginning. Al which being incomprehensible by humane wit or discourse, he knew partly by revelations from God, for he had the guift of Prophecie in most excellent sort; partly by traditions from his elders, who learned of their fathers. For until that time the Church had only traditions of such things as were revealed to special men, whereby we see the great authority of traditions, before there were Scriptures. And since Scriptures were written they are also necessary, for three special reasons. First, for that we are only assured by tradition of the Church, that those books are indeed holy Scriptures, which are so accounted, and not by the Scripture it-selfe, for that were to prove the same by the same, until we be assured of some part, that proveth some other parts. And this made S. Augustin to say plainly, that he could not believe the Ghospel, except the Church told him which is the Ghospel. Secondly, holy Scriptures being once knowen to be the word of God, & so of most eminent authoritie of al writings in the world, as S. Augustin, S. Hierome, & al other Fathers agree, yet for the true understanding of the same, both the Scripture it-selfe, and the ancient Fathers remit us to the Church, namely to those in the Church that are appointed by Gods ordinance, in the high place that he hath chosen.
