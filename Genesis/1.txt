IN the beginning God created heaven and earth. And the earth was void and vacant, and darknes was upon the face of the depth: and the Spirit of God moved over the waters. And God said: Be light made. And light was made. And God saw the light that it was good: and he divided the light from the darkenes. And he called the light, Day, and the daakenes, Night: and there was evening & morning, that made one day. God also said: Be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide between waters and waters. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament. And it was so done. And God called the firmament, Heaven: and there was evening & morning that made the second day. God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven be gathered together into one place: and let the drie land appeare. And it was so done. And God called the drie land, Earth, and the gathering of waters together, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. And said: Let the earth shoot forth green herbes, and such as may seed, & fruit-trees yealding fruit after his kind, such as may have seed in it-selfe upon the earth. And it was so done.
