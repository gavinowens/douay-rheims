IN the beginning God created heaven and earth. And the earth was void and vacant, and darknes was upon the face of the depth: and the Spirit of God moved over the waters. And God said : Be light made. And light was made. And God saw the light that it was good : and he divided the light from the darkenes. And he called the light, Day, and the daakenes, Night : and there was evening & morning, that made one day.
